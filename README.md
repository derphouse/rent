An application for sending money between housemates who all contribute rent to
one of these housemates.

Requires Python 2.7, Tornado >= 2.3, py-bcrypt, sqlalchemy (and db modules).

You will need to at the very least copy settings.json.example to settings.json
and add database details and secrets. Unless your server setup is very similar
to mine, you will probably need to make some small code changes as well.
